  <h1>Real Estate Market in Peru</h1>

  <h2>Context:</h2>
  <p>One of my primary medium-term goals is to purchase my own home. Being data-driven, I actively sought out data to analyze the real estate market, exploring opportunities within my city and country to ensure I make the most informed decision tailored to my needs and budget.</p>

  <h2>Problem:</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately, there are no freely accessible data sources for my country comparable to those available for the United States. So, I decided to create my own dataset by scraping a property sales website.</p>
  
  <h2>Strategy:</h2>
  <p>Because new properties hit the market every day, I'll run my scraping script every two weeks (I'll automate this). The fresh data will then go through an automated data processing pipeline before getting stored in a data warehouse, ready to fuel an analytics dashboard.</p>
